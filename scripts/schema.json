      "description": "The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for\ndifferent programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is\nused by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:\n\n- Simple to use and understand for most users\n- Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs\n\n# Overview\n\nThe `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error\nmessage, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of\ngoogle.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The\nerror message should be a developer-facing English message that helps\ndevelopers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing\nerror message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or\nlocalize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary\ninformation about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types\nin the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.\n\n# Language mapping\n\nThe `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it\nis not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is\nexposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be\nmapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions\nin Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.\n\n# Other uses\n\nThe error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of\nenvironments, either with or without APIs, to provide a\nconsistent developer experience across different environments.\n\nExample uses of this error model include:\n\n- Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,\n    it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial\n    errors.\n\n- Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may\n    have a `Status` message for error reporting.\n\n- Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the\n    `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for\n    each error sub-response.\n\n- Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation\n    results in its response, the status of those operations should be\n    represented directly using the `Status` message.\n\n- Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could\n    be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons."

              "description": "Creates, updates, or removes resources. This method supports atomic\ntransactions with multiple types of resources. For example, you can\natomically create a campaign and a campaign budget, or perform up to\nthousands of mutates atomically.\n\nThis method is essentially a wrapper around a series of mutate methods. The\nonly features it offers over calling those methods directly are:\n- Atomic transactions\n- Temp resource names (described below)\n- Somewhat reduced latency over making a series of mutate calls.\n\nNote: Only resources that support atomic transactions are included, so this\nmethod can't replace all calls to individual services.\n\n## Atomic Transaction Benefits\n\nAtomicity makes error handling much easier. If you're making a series of\nchanges and one fails, it can leave your account in an inconsistent state.\nWith atomicity, you either reach the desired state directly, or the request\nfails and you can retry.\n\n## Temp Resource Names\n\nTemp resource names are a special type of resource name used to create a\nresource and reference that resource in the same request. For example, if a\ncampaign budget is created with 'resource_name' equal to\n'customers/123/campaignBudgets/-1', that resource name can be reused in\nthe 'Campaign.budget' field in the same request. That way, the two\nresources are created and linked atomically.\n\nTo create a temp resource name, put a negative number in the part of the\nname that the server would normally allocate.\n\nNote:\n- Resources must be created with a temp name before the name can be reused.\n  For example, the previous CampaignBudget+Campaign example would fail if\n  the mutate order was reversed.\n- Temp names are not remembered across requests.\n- There's no limit to the number of temp names in a request.\n- Each temp name must use a unique negative number, even if the resource\n  types differ.\n\n## Latency\n\nIt's important to group mutates by resource type or the request may time\nout and fail. Latency is roughly equal to a series of calls to individual\nmutate methods, where each change in resource type is a new call. For\nexample, mutating 10 campaigns then 10 ad groups is like 2 calls, while\nmutating 1 campaign, 1 ad group, 1 campaign, 1 ad group is like 4 calls."
